Hello my name is Jake, and today I will 
be joined by An, Caiden, and Parsa. Today  

0:00:07.000,0:00:13.440
we'll be presenting an in-depth overview of our 
project VocaFree. VocaFree is a Web Application  

0:00:13.440,0:00:18.520
that uses YouTube song video links to create an 
authentic Karoake experience by separating vocals  

0:00:18.520,0:00:23.440
from the music of any song and playing just the 
instrumental track allowing users to sing any  

0:00:23.440,0:00:28.280
songs of their choice without the original songs 
vocals. It offers lyric translation as well as  

0:00:28.280,0:00:35.120
romanization to assist the user in singing along 
to the lyrics. One of the API's we are using is  

0:00:35.120,0:00:41.920
the Genius API, this API allows access to a 
database of song lyrics, artist information,  

0:00:41.920,0:00:46.800
and song metadata from the Genius platform. It 
allows you to search for songs by title or by  

0:00:46.800,0:00:52.760
excerpts of lyrics, retrieve artist profiles, and 
find lyrics to specific songs. This API is popular  

0:00:52.760,0:00:58.360
for building music related applications helping 
users discover songs and learn about artists. We  

0:00:58.360,0:01:03.320
are using this API to implement features that 
will enhance our user experience. First, it  

0:01:03.320,0:01:09.160
will allow users to retrieve lyrics for specific 
songs so they can sing along with ease. Second,  

0:01:09.160,0:01:14.200
it enables song searches based on an excerpt 
of lyrics helping users quickly find the song  

0:01:14.200,0:01:19.800
they're looking for. Lastly, the API provides 
detailed artist information and song metadata  

0:01:19.800,0:01:25.840
offering a deeper dive into artist biographies and 
song details. Now let's look at some user stories  

0:01:25.840,0:01:32.720
for the genius features to better understand how 
these features will improve user experience for  

0:01:32.720,0:01:38.360
different users. First let's meet Emma, she's a 
singer who loves performing but often finds that  

0:01:38.360,0:01:44.040
karaoke venues display inaccurate lyrics. With our 
Genius integration Emma can access artist verified  

0:01:44.040,0:01:49.800
lyrics to sing along confidently knowing she's 
got the correct words every time. Next is Sarah,  

0:01:49.800,0:01:54.720
an office worker with a hectic schedule. She 
barely has any time to explore new music,  

0:01:54.720,0:02:00.160
but she often hears Snippets of songs in ads or 
at work. With our Genius powered "Snippet Search",  

0:02:00.160,0:02:06.360
she can enter just a few words she remembers from 
songs and the app will instantly find the song  

0:02:06.360,0:02:12.200
helping her discover music effortlessly. Finally 
there's Linda, who's interested in learning about  

0:02:12.200,0:02:18.200
new artists. Since she has a physical disability 
that prohibits her to go out to music events,  

0:02:18.200,0:02:22.760
she can use our apps "Artist Info" feature 
which provides detailed artist biographies and  

0:02:22.760,0:02:28.240
song metadata from Genius. This lets Linda explore 
artist backgrounds and stay connected to the music  

0:02:28.240,0:02:35.160
industry at home. Hey, I'm Parsa and I'll go over 
Open AI API. All right, Open AI API is the most  

0:02:35.160,0:02:40.680
commonly used Large Language Model API developed 
by Open AI and used for ChatGPT. The features that  

0:02:40.680,0:02:48.120
we're looking to implement are translating lyrics, 
romanization/phonetics, and basic lyric analysis.  

0:02:48.120,0:02:52.720
Alex is passionate about learning new languages 
and the ability to translate song lyrics into  

0:02:52.720,0:02:58.520
English in real time will be helpful for him. 
Mike manages a diverse remote team and having  

0:02:58.520,0:03:03.560
romanized versions of song lyrics will provide 
a way for everybody in his team to participate  

0:03:03.560,0:03:09.880
in karaoke sessions. Emma loves singing and the 
lyrics analysis features helps her uncover hidden  

0:03:09.880,0:03:17.200
meanings behind songs and appreciate the artistry 
behind the music. Hi, my name is An. Now this is  

0:03:17.200,0:03:22.680
the demo of our mid Fidelity Story Board starting 
with our landing page. This is the page where our  

0:03:22.680,0:03:28.520
users can search for a song name; like so, and 
these are the suggested songs suggested by our  

0:03:28.520,0:03:34.440
system. If the user clicks on a song, they are 
taken to our karaoke page where they could sing  

0:03:34.440,0:03:43.320
karaoke to the lyrics shown on the UI. So on the 
UI they could see just regular video elements like  

0:03:43.320,0:03:51.480
the progress bar, the volume of the vocal guide 
which will help them sing along to the song. And  

0:03:51.480,0:03:58.040
they also have buttons to translate their lyrics 
as they're singing. If they click on this button  

0:03:59.160,0:04:05.720
they could see the translated lyrics on the 
screen like this. If they want to go back,  

0:04:05.720,0:04:11.760
simply press the back button. And if they want to 
change the language (the translated language) just  

0:04:11.760,0:04:26.080
press on the button like this. And this button 
gives them the option to chat with an AI bot.  

0:04:26.080,0:04:31.680
For example, if they want the AI to suggest them 
songs to sing, they could use this feature. And if  

0:04:31.680,0:04:35.840
they want to understand more about the songs 
they're singing they could use this feature,  

0:04:35.840,0:04:43.360
to be provided with an analysis of the song by 
AI. And last but not least, they also have the  

0:04:43.360,0:04:49.560
option to cue songs. So, for example they could 
search up the name of the song, click on a song,  

0:04:49.560,0:04:57.080
and a song is immediately added to the queue. Hi, 
my name is Caiden and today I will display to you  

0:04:57.080,0:05:01.320
how the data flows through our karaoke app. First 
we'll start with the external user, who will have  

0:05:01.320,0:05:07.840
the ability to select a song or search for a song. 
Upon using the search the user will either be able  

0:05:07.840,0:05:15.520
to search based on lyrics, or based on the song 
title/artist name as expected. When we search  

0:05:15.520,0:05:22.480
we'll interact with the Genius API and send 
the lyric data to Genius. Genius will send the  

0:05:22.480,0:05:28.800
metadata provided by the song selection to our 
YouTube downloader API. That will then send it  

0:05:28.800,0:05:35.600
over to our UVR (Ultimate Vocal Remover) API which 
will then pull the vocal data from our .mp4 song,  

0:05:35.600,0:05:41.040
so that it can be played back to the user. 
Now further, while this is completed,  

0:05:41.040,0:05:48.680
the user will then request the lyrics in either 
English, a phonetic translation, or just a normal  

0:05:48.680,0:05:55.960
translation. Which will then be sent from 
the Open AI API back to the external user.
