# **NOTE**
**Occasionally a bug exists on the backend in which causes an error on "Fetch song" posts and the backend will receive a 500 internal error.** **This will restart the backend and you'll have to** **wait to retry the song and after that it will work.**

**This service is not supported on Chromium browsers, as it doesn't allow the seeking of the playbar, or the lyrics scrolling.**

# VocaFree
**VocaFree** is a web application designed to enhance your karaoke experience by letting you **remove vocals** from ANY song, leaving just the instrumental track for an authentic karaoke experience. Powered by the Spotify API, it also allows you to search for and display lyrics or find a song based on a snippet of lyrics you remember.
